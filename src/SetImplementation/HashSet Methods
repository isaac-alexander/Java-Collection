Methods of HashSet

Method      -       Description

add(E e) - Used to add the specified element if it is not present, if it is present then return false.

clear() - Used to remove all the elements from the set.

contains(Object o) - Used to return true if an element is present in a set.

remove(Object o) - Used to remove the element if it is present in set.

iterator() - Used to return an iterator over the element in the set.

isEmpty() - Used to check whether the set is empty or not. Returns true for empty and false for a non-empty condition for set.

size() - Used to return the size of the set.

clone() - Used to create a shallow copy of the set.


Differences between HashSet and HashMap.
Basis       -   HashSet     -   HashMap

Implementation - HashSet implements a Set interface. - HashMap implements a Map interface.

Duplicates - HashSet doesn't allow duplicate values. - HashMap stores key-value pairs and doesn’t allow duplicate keys. A duplicate key replaces the old value.

Number of objects during storing objects - HashSet requires only one object add(Object o). - HashMap requires two objects put(K key, V Value) to add an element to the HashMap object.

Dummy value - HashSet internally uses a HashMap, where each element added is stored as a key with a dummy value. - HashMap does not have any concept of dummy value.

Storing or Adding a mechanism - HashSet internally uses the HashMap object to store or add the objects. - HashMap internally uses hashing to store or add objects

Faster - HashSet is slower than HashMap. - HashMap is faster than HashSet.

Insertion - HashSet uses the add() method for adding or storing data. - HashMap uses the put() method for storing data.
