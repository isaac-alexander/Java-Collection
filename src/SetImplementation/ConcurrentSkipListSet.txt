In Java, the ConcurrentSkipListSet is the part of the java.util.concurrent package and provides a scalable, thread-safe alternative to TreeSet. It is a sorted set that lets multiple threads safely access and modify the set at the same time without causing issues.

It is thread-safe.
Elements are in sorted order, and it supports navigable set operations (e.g., floor, ceiling, higher, lower).
Designed for high concurrency and to avoid contention between threads, unlike synchronized collections like TreeSet.
Example: This example demonstrates, how to use a ConcurrentSkipListSet to store unique integers in a thread-safe sorted order.

// Java Program to demonstrates the working of
// ConcurrentSkipListSet
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        ConcurrentSkipListSet<Integer> s
            = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        s.add(10);
        s.add(20);
        s.add(30);

        // Displaying the set
        System.out.println("Set: " + s);
    }
}

Output
Set: [10, 20, 30]

Declaration of ConcurrentSkipListSet
In Java, the declaration of ConcurrentSkipListSet can be done as:

ConcurrentSkipListSet<Type> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<>();

Parameter: It takes a Comparator to define custom sorting
Return Type: It returns a ConcurrentSkipListSet of elements, maintaining thread safety and sorted order.
Constructors

Constructor     -       Description

ConcurrentSkipListSet() -   It is used to construct an empty set.

ConcurrentSkipListSet(Collection<E> c)  -   It is used to construct a set with the elements of the Collection passed as the parameter.

ConcurrentSkipListSet(Comparator<E> comparator) -   It is sed to construct a new, empty set that orders its elements according to the specified comparator.

ConcurrentSkipListSet(SortedSet<E> s)   -   It is sed to construct a new set containing the same elements and using the same ordering as the specified sorted set.
