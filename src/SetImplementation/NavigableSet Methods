Methods
The following are the methods present in the NavigableSet interface.

Methods     -       Description

ceiling(E e)	-   Returns the least element in this set greater than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.

descendingIterator()    -	Returns an iterator over the elements in this set, in descending order.

descendingSet()	-   Returns a reverse order view of the elements contained in this set.

floor(E e)	-   Returns the greatest element in this set less than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.

headSet(E toElement)	-   Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are strictly less than toElement.

headSet(E toElement, boolean inclusive)	-   Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are less than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) toElement.

higher(E e)	-   Returns the least element in this set strictly greater than the given element, or null if there is no such element.

iterator()	-   Returns an iterator over the elements in this set, in ascending order.

lower(E e)	-   Returns the greatest element in this set strictly less than the given element, or null if there is no such element.

pollFirst()	-   Retrieves and removes the first (lowest) element, or returns null if this set is empty.

pollLast()	-   Retrieves and removes the last (highest) element, or returns null if this set is empty.

subSet(E fromElement, boolean fromInclusive, E toElement, boolean toInclusive)   -   Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements range from fromElement to toElement.

subSet(E fromElement, E toElement)	-   Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements range from fromElement, inclusive, to toElement, exclusive.

tailSet(E fromElement)	-   Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement.

tailSet(E fromElement, boolean inclusive)	-   Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) fromElement.

Methods Inherited from Interface java.util.SortedSet
Method      -       Description

comparator()	-   This method returns the comparator used to order the elements in this set, or null if this set uses the natural ordering of its elements.

first()	-   This method returns the first(lowest) element present in this set.

last()	-   This method returns the last(highest) element present in the set.

spliterator()	-   Creates a Spliterator over the elements in this sorted set.


Methods Inherited from Interface java.util.Set
Method      -       Description

add(element)	-   This method is used to add a specific element to the set. The function adds the element only if the specified element is not already present in the set else the function returns False if the element is already present in the Set.

addAll(collection) 	-   This method is used to append all of the elements from the mentioned collection to the existing set. The elements are added randomly without following any specific order.

clear()  	-   This method is used to remove all the elements from the set but not delete the set. The reference for the set still exists.

contains(element)	-   This method is used to check whether a specific element is present in the Set or not.
containsAll(collection) 	-   This method is used to check whether the set contains all the elements present in the given collection or not.
This method returns true if the set contains all the elements and returns false if any of the elements are missing.

equals()	-   Compares the specified object with this set for equality.

hashCode() 	-   This method is used to get the hashCode value for this instance of the Set. It returns an integer value which is the hashCode value for this instance of the Set.

isEmpty()	-   This method is used to check if a NavigableSet is empty or not.

remove(element)	-   This method is used to remove the given element from the set. This method returns True if the specified element is present in the Set otherwise it returns False.

removeAll(collection)	-   This method is used to remove all the elements from the collection which are present in the set. This method returns true if this set changed as a result of the call.

retainAll(collection)	-   This method is used to retain all the elements from the set which are mentioned in the given collection. This method returns true if this set changed as a result of the call.

size()	-   This method is used to get the size of the set. This returns an integer value which signifies the number of elements.

toArray()	-   This method is used to form an array of the same elements as that of the Set.

toArray(T[] a)	-   Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.

Methods Declared in Interface java.util.Collection
Method	        -       Description

parallelStream()	-   Returns a possibly parallel Stream with this collection as its source.

removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter)	-   Removes all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate.

stream()	-   Returns a sequential Stream with this collection as its source.

toArray?(IntFunction<T[]> generator)	-   Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection, using the provided generator function to allocate the returned array.

Methods Declared in Interface java.lang.Iterable
Method	    -       Description

forEach(Consumer<? super T> action)	    -   Performs the given action for each element of the Iterable until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception.
