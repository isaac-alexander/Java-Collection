LinkedList is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is present in the java.util package. It implements a doubly linked list where elements are stored as nodes containing data and references to the previous and next nodes, rather than in contiguous memory locations.

-The size of the LinkedList can grow or shrink dynamically at runtime.

-Maintains the order in which elements are inserted.

-Multiple duplicate elements can be stored.

-LinkedList is not thread-safe by default; it can be synchronized using Collections.synchronizedList().

-Provides better performance than ArrayList for insertion and deletion operations, especially at the beginning or middle.

import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Geeks {

    public static void main(String[] args){

        // Creating a LinkedList
        LinkedList<String> l = new LinkedList<String>();

        // Adding elements to the LinkedList using add() method
        l.add("One");
        l.add("Two");
        l.add("Three");
        l.add("Four");
        l.add("Five");

        System.out.println(l);
    }
}

Explanation:

1. Creates an empty LinkedList of Strings.
2. Adds elements "One" to "Five" using the add() method.
3. Prints the LinkedList showing elements in insertion order: [One, Two, Three, Four, Five].

Note: LinkedList nodes cannot be accessed directly by index; elements must be accessed by traversing from the head

Constructors of LinkedList
In order to create a LinkedList, we need to create an object of the LinkedList class. The LinkedList class consists of various constructors that allow the possible creation of the list. The following are the constructors available in this class:

1. LinkedList()
This constructor is used to create an empty linked list. If we wish to create an empty LinkedList with the name list, then it can be created as:

LinkedList list = new LinkedList();

2. LinkedList(Collection C)
This constructor is used to create an ordered list that contains all the elements of a specified collection, as returned by the collection's iterator. If we wish to create a LinkedList with the name list, then, it can be created as:

LinkedList list = new LinkedList(C);
