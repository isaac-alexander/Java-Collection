ArrayList in Java is a resizable array provided in the java.util package. Unlike normal arrays, its size can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

-Elements can be accessed using their index, just like arrays.

-Duplicate elements are allowed.

-Elements are stored in the order they are inserted.

-ArrayList is not thread-safe. To make it thread-safe, you must wrap it manually using Collections.synchronizedList().

import java.util.ArrayList;

class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {

      	// Creating an ArrayList
      	ArrayList<Integer> a = new ArrayList<Integer>();

      	// Adding Element in ArrayList
      	a.add(1);
      	a.add(2);
      	a.add(3);

      	// Printing ArrayList
      	System.out.println(a);
    }
}

ArrayList Constructors in Java
Java provides multiple constructors to create an ArrayList based on different requirements:

1. ArrayList()
Creates an empty ArrayList with default initial capacity.

ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();

2. ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c)
Creates an ArrayList initialized with elements from the specified collection.

ArrayList<String> arr = new ArrayList<>(collection);

3. ArrayList(int initialCapacity)
This constructor is used to build an array list with the initial capacity being specified.

ArrayList<Double> arr = new ArrayList<>(20);

Operations of ArrayList
Now, Using the constructors we have got ArrayList for further operations like Insertion,Deletion and Updation of the elements in ArrayList.
