The AbstractSequentialList class in Java is a part of the Java Collection Framework and implements the Collection interface and the AbstractCollection class. This class provides a skeletal implementation of the List interface to minimize the effort required to implement this interface backed by a "sequential access" data store.

It is used to implement an unmodifiable list, for which one needs to only extend this AbstractList Class and implement only the get() and the size() methods. AbstractSequentialList is an abstract class, so it should be assigned an instance of its subclass such as LinkedList.

import java.util.AbstractSequentialList;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class GfG {

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Creating an instance of AbstractSequentialList
        AbstractSequentialList<Integer> a = new LinkedList<>();

        // adding elements
        a.add(5);
        a.add(6);
        a.add(7);

        // Printing the list
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}

Declaration of AbstractSequentialList
public abstract class AbstractSequentialList<E>
    extends AbstractList<E>

Where E is the type of element maintained by this List.

It implements Iterable<E>, Collection<E>, List<E> interfaces. LinkedList is the only direct subclass of AbstractSequentialList.

Constructor: protected AbstractSequentialList() - The default constructor, but being protected, it doesn't allow to create an AbstractSequentialList object.

AbstractSequentialList<E> asl = new LinkedList<E>();
