The AbstractList class in Java is a part of the Java Collection Framework and implements the Collection interface and the AbstractCollection class. AbstractList class provides a skeletal implementation of the List interface to minimize the effort required to implement this interface backed by a Random Access data store.

For sequential access data (such as a linked list), AbstractSequentialList should be used in preference to this class.

To implement an unmodifiable list, for which one needs to only extend this AbstractList Class and implement the get(int) and the size() methods.

To implement a modifiable list, for which one additionally override the set​(int index, E element) method (which otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException).

If the list is variable-size, for which one should override the add(int, E) and remove(int) methods.

Declaration of AbstractList
public abstract class AbstractList<E> extends AbstractCollection<E> implements List<E>

where E is the type of elements maintained by this collection.

Constructor: protected AbstractList() - The default constructor, but being protected, it doesn't allow to create an AbstractList object.

AbstractList<E> al = new ArrayList<E>();
