Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle and is defined in the java.util package. Internally, it extends the Vector class.

-Stack class maintains insertion order and allows duplicates and null values.

-Grows dynamically when its capacity is exceeded.

-All the methods of Stack are synchronized. It is thread-safe.

-Stack is considered a legacy class, introduced in early versions of Java and a preferred solution to implement Stack Data Structure (especially when thread synchronization is not needed) is either to use ArrayDeque or LinkedList

-Stack class implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, and Serializable interfaces.

import java.util.Stack;

public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Create a new stack
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();

        // Push elements onto the stack
        s.push(1);
        s.push(2);
        s.push(3);
        s.push(4);

        // Pop elements from the stack
        while (!s.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(s.pop());
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

-Elements are added to the stack using the push() method, placing each item on top.

-A loop runs while the stack is not empty, checked using the empty() method.

-Elements are removed and printed using the pop() method in LIFO order.

Constructors of Stack in Java
In order to create a Stack, we need to create an object of the Stack class. The Stack class inherits constructors from the Vector class.

1. Stack()
This constructor is used to create an empty stack.

Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>()

2. Stack(int initialCapacity)
This constructor is used to create a stack with a specified initial capacity.

Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>(20);

Methods in Stack Class

Method          Description

empty() -   This method returns true if nothing is on the top of the stack. Else, returns false.

peek()  -   This method returns the element on the top of the stack, but does not remove it.

pop()   -   This method removes and returns the top element of the stack.

push(Object element)    -   This method pushes an element on the top of the stack.

search(Object element)  -   This method is used to determine whether an object exists in the stack. If the element is found,It returns the position of the element from the top of the stack. Else, it returns -1.

Methods Inherited from the Vector Class

Method          Description

get(int index)	-   This method returns the element at the specified position in the Vector.

hashCode()	-   This method returns the hash code value for the Vector.

indexOf(Object o)	-   This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this vector or -1 if this vector does not contain the element.

indexOf(Object o, int index)	-   This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this vector, searching forwards from the index or returns -1 if the element is not found.

insertElementAt(Object o, int index)    -	This method inserts the specified object as a component in this vector at the specified index.

isEmpty()	-   This method tests if this vector has no components.

iterator()	-   This method returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence.

lastElement()	   -    This method returns the last component of the vector.

lastIndexOf(Object o)	-   This method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this vector or -1 If this vector does not contain the element.

lastIndexOf(Object o, int index)	-   This method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this vector, searching backward from the index or returns -1 if the element is not found.

listIterator()	-   This method returns a list iterator over the elements in this list (in proper sequence).

listIterator(int index)	-   This method returns a list iterator over the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.

remove(int index)	-   This method removes the element at the specified position in this Vector.

remove(Object o)	-   This method removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this Vector If the Vector does not contain the element, it is unchanged.
