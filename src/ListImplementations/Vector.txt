Vector is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed. It is part of the java.util package and extends the AbstractList class.

-Maintains insertion order and allows duplicate and null values.

-Dynamically grows its size when capacity is exceeded.

-Implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, and Serializable interfaces.

-Vector is a Legacy class that was introduced in early versions of Java.

-Thread-safe: All methods are synchronized for safe multi-threaded access.

-ArrayList is preferred over vector in general when in-built thread synchronization is not required..

import java.util.Vector;

public class GFG{

    public static void main(String[] args){

        Vector<String> v = new Vector<>();
        v.add("A");
        v.add("B");
        v.add("C");
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}

Hierarchy of Vector
It implements the List interface, which is a sub-interface of the Collection interface.

Constructors of Vector
In order to create a Vector, we need to create an object of the Vector class. The Vector class provides various constructors to create a vector in different ways.

1. Vector()
Creates an empty vector with a default initial capacity of 10.

Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>();

2. Vector(int initialCapacity)
Creates a vector with the specified initial capacity.

Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>(20);

3. Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement)
Creates a vector with a specified initial capacity and capacity increment (amount by which the vector grows when full).

Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>(10, 5);

4. Vector(Collection c)
Creates a vector containing all elements of the specified collection.

Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>(collection);

Vector Capacity in Java
When a Vector is created using the default constructor, it is initialized with a default capacity of 10. This means it can hold up to 10 elements before needing to grow in size. If the number of elements exceeds the current capacity, the Vector automatically increases its capacity.

Vector<String> vec = new Vector<>();

System.out.println("Default Capacity: " + vec.capacity()); // Output: 10

Formula to calculate new capacity

newCapacity = oldCapacity * 2
