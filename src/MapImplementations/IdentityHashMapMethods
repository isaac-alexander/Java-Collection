Methods of IdentityHashMap
K – The type of the keys in the map.
V – The type of values mapped in the map.

METHOD      -       DESCRIPTION

clear()	-   Removes all of the mappings from this map.

clone()	-   Returns a shallow copy of this identity hash map: the keys and values themselves are not cloned.

containsKey?(Object key)	-   Tests whether the specified object reference is a key in this identity hash map.

containsValue?(Object value)	-   Tests whether the specified object reference is a value in this identity hash map.

entrySet()	-   Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map.

equals?(Object o)	-   Compares the specified object with this map for equality.

get?(Object key)	-   Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key.

hashCode()	-   Returns the hash code value for this map.

isEmpty()	-   Returns true if this identity hash map contains no key-value mappings.

keySet()	-   Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map.

put?(K key, V value)	-   Associates the specified value with the specified key in this identity hash map.

putAll?(Map<? extends K,?? extends V> m)	-   Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map.

remove?(Object key)	-   Removes the mapping for this key from this map if present.

size()	-   Returns the number of key-value mappings in this identity hash map.

values()	-   Returns a Collection view of the values contained in this map.

METHOD      -       DESCRIPTION

compute?(K key, BiFunction<? super K,?? super V,?? extends V> remappingFunction)	-   Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current mapped value (or null if there is no current mapping).

computeIfAbsent?(K key, Function<? super K,?? extends V> mappingFunction)	  - If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless null.

computeIfPresent?(K key, BiFunction<? super K,?? super V,?? extends V> remappingFunction)	-   If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

forEach?(BiConsumer<? super K,?? super V> action)	-   Performs the given action for each entry in this map until all entries have been processed or the action throws an exception.

getOrDefault?(Object key, V defaultValue)	-   Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or defaultValue if this map contains no mapping for the key.

merge?(K key, V value, BiFunction<? super V,?? super V,?? extends V> remappingFunction)	-   If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.

putIfAbsent?(K key, V value)	-   If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null) associates it with the given value and returns null, else returns the current value.

remove?(Object key, Object value)	-   Removes the entry for the specified key only if it is currently mapped to the specified value.

replace?(K key, V value)	-   Replaces the entry for the specified key only if it is currently mapped to some value.

replace?(K key, V oldValue, V newValue)	-   Replaces the entry for the specified key only if currently mapped to the specified value.

replaceAll?(BiFunction<? super K,?? super V,?? extends V> function)	-   Replaces each entry's value with the result of invoking the given function on that entry until all entries have been processed or the function throws an exception.
