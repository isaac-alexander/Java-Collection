Methods of Hashtable
K – The type of the keys in the map.
V – The type of values mapped in the map.

Method      -       Description

clear()	-   Clears this hashtable so that it contains no keys.

clone()	-   Creates a shallow copy of this hashtable.

compute(K key, BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)   -   Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current mapped value (or null if there is no current mapping).

computeIfAbsent(K key, Function<? super K,? extends V> mappingFunction) -
If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless null.

computeIfPresent(K key, BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)	-   If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

contains(Object value)	-   Tests if some key maps into the specified value in this hashtable.

containsKey(Object key)	-   Tests if the specified object is a key in this hashtable.

containsValue(Object value)	-   Returns true if this hashtable maps one or more keys to this value.

elements()	-   Returns an enumeration of the values in this hashtable.

entrySet()	-   Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map.

equals(Object o)	-   Compares the specified Object with this Map for equality, as per the definition in the Map interface.

get(Object key)	-   Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key.

hashCode()	-   Returns the hash code value for this Map as per the definition in the Map interface.

isEmpty()	-   Tests if this hashtable maps no keys to values.

keys()	-   Returns an enumeration of the keys in this hashtable.

keySet()	-   Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this map.

merge(K key, V value, BiFunction<? super V,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)	If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.

put(K key, V value)	-   Maps the specified key to the specified value in this hashtable.

putAll(Map<? extends K,? extends V> t)	-   Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this hashtable.

rehash()	-   Increases the capacity of and internally reorganizes this hashtable, in order to accommodate and access its entries more efficiently.

remove(Object key)	-   Removes the key (and its corresponding value) from this hashtable.

size()	-   Returns the number of keys in this hashtable.

toString()	-   Returns a string representation of this Hashtable object in the form of a set of entries, enclosed in braces and separated by the ASCII characters ", " (comma and space).

 values()	-   Returns a Collection view of the values contained in this map.

 Methods Declared in interface java.util.Map

Method     -       Description

  forEach(BiConsumer<? super K,? super V> action)	-   Performs the given action for each entry in this map until all entries have been processed or the action throws an exception.

 getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue)	-   Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or defaultValue if this map contains no mapping for the key.

 putIfAbsent(K key, V value)	-   If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null) associates it with the given value and returns null, else returns the current value.

 remove(Object key, Object value)  -   Removes the entry for the specified key only if it is currently mapped to the specified value.

 replace(K key, V value)	-   Replaces the entry for the specified key only if it is currently mapped to some value.

 replace(K key, V oldValue, V newValue)	-   Replaces the entry for the specified key only if currently mapped to the specified value.

 replaceAll(BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> function)	-   Replaces each entry's value with the result of invoking the given function on that entry until all entries have been processed or the function throws an exception.
