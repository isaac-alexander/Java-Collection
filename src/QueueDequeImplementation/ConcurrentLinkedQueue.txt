ConcurrentLinkedQueue is the part of the java.util.concurrent package and implements a FIFO(First-In-First-Out) queue. It is a thread-safe, non-blocking, and scalable queue designed for use in highly concurrent environments. The queue uses a lock-free algorithm, ensuring that multiple threads can safely enqueue and dequeue elements without the need for external synchronization.

The queue allows multiple threads to perform operations without locking

It can be accessed by multiple threads concurrently without causing data corruption

The queue maintains the order of elements as they are added

Example: This example demonstrates creating a thread-safe ConcurrentLinkedQueue, adding elements to it and printing the queue.

import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue;

public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args){

        ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Integer> q = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();

        q.offer(1);
        q.offer(2);
        q.offer(3);

        System.out.println("Queue after adding elements: " + q);
    }
}

Output
Queue after adding elements: [1, 2, 3]

Declaration of ConcurrentLinkedQueue
In Java, the declaration of ConcurrentLinkedQueue can be done as:

ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Type> queueName = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();

Constructors

Constructor     -       Description

ConcurrentLinkedQueue() -   It  is used to construct an empty queue.

ConcurrentLinkedQueue(Collection<E> c)  -   It  is used to construct a queue with the elements of the Collection passed as the parameter.
