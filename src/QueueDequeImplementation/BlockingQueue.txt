BlockingQueue is part of the java.util.concurrent package and extends the Queue interface. It represents a thread-safe queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space to become available when storing an element.

Thread Safe: BlockingQueue implementations are thread-safe, with all methods being atomic.

Blocking Operation: Has blocking behavior if the queue is full (for producers) or empty (for consumers).

No Null Elements: Attempts to insert a null will result in a NullPointerException.

Declaration
    public interface BlockingQueue<E> extends Queue<E>

Here, E is the type of elements stored in the Collection.

import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;

public class GFG{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{

        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(3);

        // Add elements
        queue.put(1);
        queue.put(2);
        queue.put(3);

        System.out.println("BlockingQueue: " + queue);
    }
}
Output
BlockingQueue: [1, 2, 3]

Classes that Implement BlockingQueue
LinkedBlockingQueue: An optionally bounded blocking queue backed by linked nodes, usually with higher throughput than ArrayBlockingQueue.
ArrayBlockingQueue: A bounded blocking queue backed by an array that stores elements in FIFO order.
Types of BlockingQueue
There are two types of BlockingQueue.

1. Unbounded Queue
Unbounded Queue is a queue that has no fixed capacity limit, allowing elements to be added indefinitely until system memory is exhausted.

BlockingQueue blockingQueue = new LinkedBlockingDeque();

2. Bounded Queue
Bounded Queue is a queue with a fixed capacity that limits the number of elements it can hold at a time.

BlockingQueue blockingQueue = new LinkedBlockingDeque(5);
