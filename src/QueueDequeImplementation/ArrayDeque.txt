ArrayDeque is a resizable-array implementation of the Deque interface in Java. It is part of java.util package provides a double-ended queue implementation, allowing elements to be added or removed from both ends efficiently.

ArrayDeque grows dynamically.

It generally provides faster operations than LinkedList as it is more cache friendly and does not require overhead of next previous reference management.

Operations like addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), removeLast() are all done in constant time O(1).

ArrayDeque is not Thread-Safe


Declaration of ArrayDeque
In Java, the declaration of ArrayDeque can be done as:

    ArrayDeque<Type> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

Here, "Type" is the type of the element the deque will hold (e.g. Integer, String).
import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Deque;

public class Geeks {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Deque<Integer> d = new ArrayDeque<>();
        d.addFirst(1);
        d.addLast(2);
        int f = d.removeFirst();
        int l = d.removeLast();
        System.out.println("First: " + f + ", Last: " + l);
    }
}
Output
First: 1, Last: 2

Constructors of ArrayDeque
1. ArrayDeque()
This constructor is used to create an empty ArrayDeque and by default holds an initial capacity to hold 16 elements.

ArrayDeque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

2. ArrayDeque(Collection<? extends E> c)
This constructor is used to create an ArrayDeque containing all the elements the same as that of the specified collection.

ArrayDeque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>(list);

3. ArrayDeque(int numofElements)
This constructor is used to create an empty ArrayDeque and holds the capacity to contain a specified number of elements.

ArrayDeque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>(25); // capacity = 25
