A PriorityQueue in Java is a queue where elements are ordered based on their priority, rather than the order of insertion. By default, it uses natural ordering (min-heap), but a custom comparator can be used to define different priorities.

-Elements are processed based on priority rather than insertion order.

-Supports standard queue operations like add(), poll(), and peek().

-Automatically grows as elements are added.
-Uses a heap data structure internally to ensure efficient insertion and removal of the highest-priority element.


Declaration of PriorityQueue
    public class PriorityQueue<E> extends AbstractQueue<E> implements Serializable

where, E is the type of elements held in this queue.

import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Geeks
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
      	// Priority Queue Min Type
        PriorityQueue<Integer> p = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // Add elements to the queue
        p.add(3);
        p.add(10);
        p.add(7);
        p.add(2);

        // Print the head of the queue
        System.out.println("Head of Queue: " + p.peek());
    }
}
Output
Head of Queue: 2

Constructors of PriorityQueue
1. PriorityQueue()
This method creates a PriorityQueue with the default initial capacity (11) that orders its elements according to their natural ordering.

PriorityQueue<E> pq = new PriorityQueue<E>();

2. PriorityQueue(int initialCapacity)
This creates a PriorityQueue with the specified initial capacity that orders its elements according to their natural ordering.

PriorityQueue<E> pq = new PriorityQueue<E>(int initialCapacity);

3. PriorityQueue(Comparator<E> comparator)
This creates a PriorityQueue with the default initial capacity and whose elements are ordered according to the specified comparator.

PriorityQueue<E> pq = new PriorityQueue<E>(Comparator<E> c);

4. PriorityQueue(int initialCapacity, Comparator<E> comparator)
This creates a PriorityQueue with the specified initial capacity that orders its elements according to the specified comparator.

PriorityQueue<E> pq = new PriorityQueue<E>(int initialCapacity, Comparator<E> comparator);
