The List interface in Java extends the Collection interface and is part of the java.util package. It is used to store ordered collections where duplicates are allowed and elements can be accessed by their index.

-Maintains insertion order
-Allows duplicate elements
-Supports null elements (implementation dependent)
-Supports bidirectional traversal using ListIterator

Declaration of Java List Interface
public interface List<E> extends Collection<E> { }

To use a List, we must instantiate a class that implements it. Example classes that implement it are ArrayList and LinkedList

List<Type> list = new ArrayList<Type>();

The common implementation classes of the List interface are:

-ArrayList: It is implemented using resizable array, offers fast random access but slower insert/delete.

-LinkedList: It is implemented using Doubly-linked list, efficient for frequent insertions and deletions.

-Vector: It is implemented using Legacy synchronized dynamic array, thread-safe but slower.

-Stack: It is implemented using a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) subclass of Vector for stack operations.
