The Collection interface is the root of the Java Collections Framework, defined in the java.util package. It represents a group of individual objects as a single unit and provides basic operations for working with them.

-Dynamic in Nature: Collections can automatically grow or shrink in size, unlike arrays that have a fixed length.

-Stores Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Objects: Can hold same-type or different-type elements based on implementation.

-Easy to Use: Provides convenient methods such as add(), remove(), and clear() to manage elements effortlessly.

-Efficient Traversal: Allows easy access and processing of elements using loops or iterators.

Collection Interface Declaration
public interface Collection<E> extends Iterable<E>

Here, E represents the type of elements stored in the collection.

Object Creation of Collection Interface
Collection<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();

In Java, we cannot create an object of an interface directly. Instead, we create an object of the ArrayList class that implements the interface and assign it to the interface reference.

Sub-Interfaces of Collection Interface
The subinterfaces of Collection, also called collection types, are:

1. List:
-List represents an ordered collection that allows duplicates.
-Elements can be accessed by index.
-Implementing Classes: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack.
-Declaration:
    public interface List<E> extends Collection<E>

2. Set:
S-et represents an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.
-Implementing Classes: HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet, EnumSet, CopyOnWriteArraySet.
-Declaration:
    public interface Set<E> extends Collection<E>

3. SortedSet:
-SortedSet extends Set and maintains elements in a sorted order.
-Provides methods to handle range-based operations.
-Implementing Class: TreeSet.
-Declaration:
    public interface SortedSet<E> extends Set<E>

4. NavigableSet:
-NavigableSet extends SortedSet and provides navigation methods like lower(), floor(), ceiling(), and higher().
-Implementing Class: TreeSet.
-Declaration:
    public interface NavigableSet<E> extends SortedSet<E>

5. Queue:
-Queue represents a collection following FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.
-Implementing Classes: PriorityQueue, Deque, ArrayDeque, LinkedList
-Declaration:
    public interface Queue<E> extends Collection<E>

6. Deque:
-Deque extends Queue and allows elements to be added/removed from both ends.
-Implementing Classes: ArrayDeque, LinkedList.
-Declaration:
    public interface Deque<E> extends Queue<E>
