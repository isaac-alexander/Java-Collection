Java Collection Framework (JCF) is a set of classes and interfaces that provide ready-made data structures to store and manipulate groups of objects efficiently.

-Java provides collection interfaces like List, Set, Map, and Queue, with ready-made classes such as ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, and PriorityQueue, so you don’t have to write data-handling code from scratch.

-The Collection Framework improves productivity by making code more reusable, maintainable and faster to develop.

FEATURES OF JAVA COLLECTION FRAMEWORK
1. Provides ready-to-use data structures (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap).9
2. Offers interfaces (Collection, List, Set, Map, Queue) to define standard behaviors.
3. Supports dynamic resizing, unlike arrays with a fixed size.
4. Includes algorithms (sorting, searching, iteration) via the Collections utility class.
5. Improves code reusability and performance by reducing boilerplate code.


1.Core Interfaces
The foundation of the Collections Framework is built on interfaces like Collection, List, Set, Queue, Deque and Map.They define the behavior of different collection types and serve as a blueprint for implementations.

-Collection Interface
-List Interface
-Set Interface
-Queue Interface
-Deque Interface
-Map Interface

2. List Implementations
Lists represent ordered collections that allow duplicate elements and positional access. They include dynamic arrays, linked structures and legacy classes designed for sequential storage.

-ArrayList
-LinkedList
-Vector
-Stack
-AbstractList
-AbstractSequentialList

3. Set Implementations
Sets represent collections of unique elements, disallowing duplicates. They provide implementations with different ordering strategies like hashing, insertion order or sorting.

-HashSet
-Linked HashSet
-TreeSet
-EnumSet
-SortedSet Interface
-NavigableSet
-ConcurrentSkipListSet

4. Queue / Deque Implementations
Queues store elements in a FIFO manner, while Deques allow operations at both ends. They are used for scheduling, buffering and producer-consumer applications.

-Priority Queue
-Array Deque
-BlockingQueue
-ConcurrentLinked Queue
-Abstract Queue

5. Map Implementations
Maps store data as key-value pairs where keys are unique. Different implementations provide hashing, ordering, reference-based and concurrent behaviors.

-HashMap
-LinkedHashMap
-TreeMap
-WeakHashMap
-IdentityHashMap
-HashTable

6. Utility and Supporting Classes
Java provides helper classes and interfaces to enhance collection usage. They include Collections, Iterator, Comparator and other tools for iteration and sorting.

-Collections Class
-Iterable interface
-ListIterator
-Enumeration
-Comparator
-Comparable

7. Concurrency Collections
Concurrent collections are designed for multi-threaded environments. They ensure thread-safe access without compromising performance.

-ConcurrentHashMap
-CopyOnWriteArrayList
-ConcurrentLinkedQueue
-BlockingQueue (ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue )
